#### III. Main Reasons for the Change in This Period's Performance
The year - on - year decline in the performance during the reporting period is mainly due to the impact of the macro - economy. In 2024, customers were more cautious in their procurement decisions. The tendering time points were postponed compared with previous years, and the acceptance process took longer. As a result, the Company's overall revenue recognition was delayed, leading to a decline in revenue and an expansion of losses.

During the reporting period, the Company had a relatively sufficient volume of on - hand orders, which increased compared with the same period of the previous year. With the continuous progress of technology and the continuous advancement of industry demand, the big data infrastructure and AI infrastructure have been further deeply integrated. The Company will continue to be committed to providing big data and AI tools to promote the efficient integration of data and intelligence, reshape the interaction mode between people and data in enterprise applications, improve the production efficiency and business efficiency of enterprises, and fully realize the value of data.
