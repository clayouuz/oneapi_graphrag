    "content": "## 《The Last Lightkeeper》\n\nThe storm arrived without warning, as storms often do on the remote islands of Maine. One moment, the sky was its usual pale gray, the next it had deepened to an ominous charcoal, with clouds churning like smoke from a great fire. The wind, which had been blowing steadily from the northeast, suddenly shifted and intensified, whipping the sea into a frenzy of whitecaps.\n\nIn the lighthouse atop the cliff, Eleanor Harper paused in her routine maintenance of the Fresnel lens. The sudden change in pressure made her ears pop, and she felt the ancient stone tower shudder as a particularly strong gust slammed into it. Setting down her cleaning cloth, she moved to the western window, her boots clicking against the iron grating.\n\nWhat she saw made her breath catch. The horizon had disappeared, swallowed by an advancing wall of blackness. Lightning flickered within the clouds, illuminating them from within like some monstrous lantern. The sea, usually visible for miles, had been reduced to a churning maelstrom just beyond the rocks at the base of the cliff.\n\n\"Damn,\" she muttered, reaching for the radio. \"Coast Guard Station Rockland, this is Harper at Widow's Point Light. We've got a serious squall line moving in from the west. Estimating winds already at 50 knots and building.\"\n\nThe radio crackled with static before the reply came through. \"Copy that, Widow's Point. We're seeing it on radar. You battened down over there?\"\n\nEleanor glanced around the lantern room. \"As much as we can be. I'll do a final check of the outbuildings. This looks like it could be a bad one.\"\n\n\"Roger that. Keep us posted. Coast Guard Station Rockland out.\"\n\nThe lightkeeper moved quickly down the spiral staircase, her hand brushing against the cold stone wall out of long habit. In the equipment room on the first floor, she grabbed her heavy weather gear - yellow slicker, rubber boots, and sou'wester hat. The wind was howling now, a high-pitched wail that seemed to come from all directions at once.\n\nAs she stepped outside, the full force of the storm hit her. Rain came in horizontal sheets, stinging any exposed skin. The wind threatened to tear the hat from her head, and she had to lean into it to make progress toward the storage shed. Salt spray from the waves crashing against the cliff below reached even this high, mixing with the rain to coat everything in a briny mist.\n\nEleanor fought her way to the shed, checking that the doors were securely latched. The generator housing came next, then the fuel tanks. Everything seemed secure, but she knew from experience that even small oversights could have disastrous consequences in weather like this.\n\nA particularly violent gust nearly knocked her off her feet, and she decided it was time to get back inside. As she turned toward the lighthouse, a flash of movement caught her eye. Something pale was tumbling through the air, tossed about by the wind like a piece of paper. It took her a moment to realize it was a bird - a large white gull, struggling vainly against the storm.\n\nThe bird crashed to the ground a few yards away, one wing clearly injured. It tried to stand, only to be knocked over by another gust. Eleanor hesitated. Common sense told her to get inside, but something about the bird's plight struck a chord. Maybe it was the way it kept trying to rise despite its injury, or maybe it was just the loneliness of the island getting to her. Whatever the reason, she found herself moving toward the fallen gull.\n\nThe bird flapped wildly as she approached, but was too weak to do more than scrabble at the ground with its good wing. Eleanor managed to get her hands around its body, feeling the rapid heartbeat through the feathers. She tucked it inside her slicker, shielding it from the rain as best she could, and made her way back to the lighthouse.\n\nInside, she set up a makeshift nest for the bird in a corner of the kitchen, using an old blanket and some towels. The gull watched her with one bright eye, its head tilted at an angle that gave it a curiously intelligent expression. As she worked, Eleanor found herself talking to it, something she hadn't done since her husband Tom had passed.\n\n\"Looks like you and I are in for a rough night,\" she said, gently examining the injured wing. \"But don't worry, this old lighthouse has weathered worse. Just you wait and see.\"\n\nThe gull made a soft croaking sound, almost as if in response. Outside, the storm continued to build, the wind now screaming like a living thing. The lighthouse stood firm, its beacon cutting through the darkness, a steady pulse of light in the chaos.\n\nAs night fell and the storm reached its peak, Eleanor sat in the lantern room, watching the play of lightning across the waves. The injured gull rested in a box at her feet, occasionally making soft noises. In that moment, she didn't feel quite so alone. The storm would pass, as all storms do, and the light would continue to shine, guiding ships safely through the darkness. It was what she had dedicated her life to, and she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThe next morning dawned clear and bright, the storm having blown itself out during the night. Eleanor stood on the catwalk outside the lantern room, surveying the damage. There were a few downed branches and some minor flooding, but nothing serious. The gull, its wing now splinted, perched on the railing beside her, gazing out at the calm sea.\n\nIn the distance, a fishing boat appeared, its white hull gleaming in the sunlight. Eleanor raised a hand in greeting, and the gull let out a loud cry, as if joining in the salute. Life on Widow's Point would go on, as it always had, with the lighthouse standing watch over the sea and all who sailed upon it. And Eleanor Harper, the last lightkeeper, would be there to keep the flame burning, just as she had for the past thirty years."
